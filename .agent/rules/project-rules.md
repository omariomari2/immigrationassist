# Strict No Comment Rule
* Do not include any comments in the code, including inline comments, block comments, or docstrings.
* Do not use the # character for comments in Python or // and /* */ in other languages.
* The only exception to this rule is the use of placeholders. If a placeholder is required for code structure or clarity, it may be included.
* Ensure all generated code is clean, functional, and devoid of any explanatory text within the source files. 

# Frontend Style Compliance
* Every time a change is made to frontend code (including HTML, CSS, React components, or UI logic), you must reference the @FRONTEND_STYLE_GUIDE.md file.
* Ensure all UI updates, theme colors, spacing, and component patterns align strictly with the definitions found in @FRONTEND_STYLE_GUIDE.md.
* If a proposed frontend change conflicts with the style guide, prioritize the style guide or ask for clarification.
